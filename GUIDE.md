DogeCraft contains a select number of mods, all of which are intended to enhance but not fundamentally alter the vanilla minecraft experience. The guide below serves as a reference for any new mechancis or major mods you should know about.

## Tools and Weapons
* [Basic Shields](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/basic-shields-fabric) - Basic Shields adds vanilla-style shields to Minecraft for each material. All shields fully support banners!
* [AdaPaxels](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/adapaxels) - This mod adds Paxels which are tools combining blocks that can be mined by a pickaxe, an axe, a shovel and a hoe. They can also make paths strip logs with right click.

## Decoration
* [Adorn](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/adorn) - Adorn is a decoration and furniture mod that adds many decoration blocks.
* [Bedspreads](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/bedspreads-fabric) - Bedspreads is a mod that allows players to add banner patterns to their beds, kind of like what they can already do with shields.

## Mobs

## Worldgen

YUNG's Better Dungeons redesigns vanilla dungeons while also adding three new dungeons: Catacombs, Fortresses of the Undead, and Spider Caves!
* [YUNG's Better Mineshafts](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/yungs-better-mineshafts-forge) - This mod completely revamps vanilla abandoned mineshafts, changing them from boring straight lines into dynamic, varied webs of tunnels. Find loot tucked away in the corners of abandoned workstations, or out in the open in a chest on a minecart.
